Here we are Learning about the Daatype s
like 
const 1 =10;
let name ='john';
let number=20.5;

// Data Conversion i got Some value from web page where it is In string but i want to use it in number so we have to convert it Numbe r

console.log(typeof(valueINnumber));

// CONVERSIONS 
// If you convert the Number it will get Converted Very Easily 
// But a='adc123' it will give NAN as Output 
// 'True' it will be Converted into the NUmber as 1 
// Can convert Number to string but not String to Number 

// OPERATIONS IN JAVA

// if 1+2+'2' It will be 32
